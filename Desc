The Browser History Analyzer is a digital forensics tool developed in Python that extracts and analyzes web browsing activity from a user’s browser history database.

Every web browser (such as Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, or Firefox) stores visited URLs, timestamps, and metadata in an internal SQLite database.
This project reads that database file, extracts relevant information (like visited websites, titles, and visit times), and presents it in a structured, readable format.

The analyzer can:

Generate detailed reports of browsing activity,

Identify the most frequently visited domains,

Visualize user activity patterns over time,

Filter data by date or keyword (e.g., show only visits to “bank” or “facebook”), and

Export evidence as CSV or PDF for documentation.

By interpreting browsing behavior, investigators or analysts can infer the user’s intent, habits, and possible involvement in specific events.

 Technical Overview

Input: Chrome “History” SQLite database file

Processing:

Extracts URLs, titles, and visit timestamps

Converts browser timestamps into readable human time

Analyzes frequency of visits per domain or time period

Optionally filters or visualizes data (bar/line charts)

Output:

CSV or PDF report summarizing findings

Graphs showing top domains and browsing times

 Real-World Applications
🔹 1. Digital Forensics Investigations

Used by cybercrime investigators to reconstruct a suspect’s browsing history.

Helps identify whether someone accessed illegal websites, leaked data, or performed reconnaissance before an attack.

Can be used in timeline correlation — matching browsing times with other digital evidence (emails, logs, or file access).

🔹 2. Corporate / Insider Threat Analysis

Security teams can use it to detect policy violations or unauthorized browsing on company devices.

Example: Detecting visits to file-sharing or competitor websites from work systems.

🔹 3. Parental Control & Monitoring Tools

Parents or guardians can monitor children’s browsing activity to ensure safe internet use.

Can detect access to inappropriate or risky content.

🔹 4. Behavioral Profiling

Researchers or analysts can study user behavior patterns, such as when people are most active online, which domains they visit most, and what kind of content they engage with.

🔹 5. Incident Response & Threat Hunting

In cybersecurity operations, it helps analysts trace how a phishing or malware infection occurred.

By analyzing history, investigators can identify the source site of a malicious download or compromised link.

🔹 6. Law Enforcement Evidence Collection

When a computer or device is seized, browsing history provides key evidence of user intent, such as:

Searching for crime-related topics

Visiting specific communication forums

Accessing dark web sites

🔹 7. User Productivity and Research Analysis

In corporate environments, the same logic can be used for productivity tracking — e.g., analyzing how much time employees spend on work-related vs. personal websites.

In research, it can be used to understand information-seeking behavior (e.g., how students use online learning platforms).
